# Hello! Welcome to Fewdly, a Parade project

## Overview
This project is designed to go over some basic Django and Django Rest Framework skills.
Fewdly is a simple food review app (think Yelp). We are about to pitch our idea
to some high-profile VCs, but we need a build a proof-of-concept first.
Here is what needs to be done:

## Models
Let's get started with some models. We need to represent our data somehow.
Think about what might be needed in a food app. Here are some ideas:
- Reviewers
- Reviews
- Restaurants

## Serializers
This is optional. Feel free to create some serializers for your models using Django Rest Framework.
You are also welcome to just live the built-in Django serializers.

## API & Views
How are people supposed to see their reviews? We need to expose this via an API.
Fill out `urls.py` and `views.py` so that we can perform the basic CRUD
operations on all our models.

As for the actual view templates, don't go too crazy. Feel free to use the DRF
API views for something quick and simple.


## Permissions
Should everyone be able to post reviews? How about restaurants? Let's add
some permission restrictions to our API. Think about what might make sense
and go for it.

## Testing
Let's test our API! Add some tests :)

## Conclusion
You're done! Fewdly is on its way to becoming the next big thing :)
